## Africa Hack Trip - Documentary Treatment

When we hear about software, hacking and entrepreneuship, most of the development seems to happen in the U.S., Europe and some places in Asia(*). Africa, the forgotten continent?

In October 2013 a group of software developers, designers and bloggers will travel to Africa in order to explore the local tech communities. From our research we know that there's a lot going on down there. Now we want to see and experience it ourselves. We will be visiting four countries: Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. At every stop we will organize a hack event together with the local people. We will work together, learn from them, see what they can do.

In areas such as mobile computing or micropayments, these places are actually more technologically advanced than we are in Europe or the U.S.. We want to see how it works in real life with our own eyes. And with our cameras. We will talk to local hackers and entrepreneurs, look at what they do and document everything. And when we come back we will show the world what we have learned.
